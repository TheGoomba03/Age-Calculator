# Age-Calculator
I am creating an age calculator program to learn java and practice.
First version.
Working only by console.

Features:  
It supports only the spanish language.  
Calculates the age, age in weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds and the remaining days for the user's birthday.  
Shows a celebration message when it's the user's birthday.  
Shows interesting facts such as the zodiac sign and what's celebrated in that day.  
Compare the age of 2 users.

Future features:  
Web site.
